_We updated the guidance on GOV.UK for publishing brownfield land registers, improved the data pages on this site, and published discovery reports for the local plans, and single register of planning projects._

## [Brownfield Sites](https://digital-land.github.io/project/brownfield-sites/)

Our updated [guidance on publishing brownfield land data](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/brownfield-land-registers-data-standard/publish-your-brownfield-land-data) is now live on GOV.UK. This is compatible with the [old data standard](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/653657/BrownfieldLandRegisters_-_DataStandard.pdf), but with some important clarifications.

Adam and Colm have been updating our [brownfield site data validator](http://brownfield-sites-validator.herokuapp.com/) to match our changes to the guidance. Our research told us how people using validators often feel demotivated, like they've just failed a test. So we've been experimenting with ways of presenting the results, telling people what they need to do to fix an issue, rather than just saying what's wrong.

We've also begun to [collect brownfield land](https://github.com/digital-land/brownfield-sites-collection) data each night, and show the results on this site. This will help us test the performance of our work to help local planning authorities to publish better data more frequently.

## [Compulsory Purchase Orders](https://digital-land.github.io/project/compulsory-purchase-orders/)
Matt and Lorna held a workshop with Tom and the policy team to find ways improving the data we hold about the CPO process, using insights from testing our prototype dashboard with users.

## [Developer contributions](https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/)
Helena and Lorna have spent this week writing user stories for each of the areas of the infrastructure funding statement legislation. They have also been developing workshop materials ahead of visiting each of the authorities participating in our private beta.

## Team

Helena, Michael, Emily and Jake redesigned the project pages to reflect different phases of each project’s life cycle, making it easier to read, and simpler for us to maintain without losing the history of each project.  This meant we could finally publish the [local plans discovery report](https://digital-land.github.io/project/local-plans/discovery), and the [single register of planning discovery and alpha report](https://digital-land.github.io/project/single-register-of-planning/discovery/) on our project pages.

Paul, Jake, Adam and Colm spent some time this week reviewing how we collect and analyse files published by local planning authorities. Paul sketched out a new structure for our website and repositories, which we’re now in the process of implementing, starting with our [organisation](https://digital-land.github.io/organisation/) pages.

Paul has begun contributing to a [wikidata project](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata_talk:WikiProject_UK_and_Ireland/adm/England) to help us link to local authority websites, and information about development corporations and other organisations which don't appear in government registers.

These will be our last weeknotes until December as we expect [purdah](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/election-guidance-for-civil-servants) to apply next week.
