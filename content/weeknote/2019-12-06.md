_We look back on what the Digital Land team worked on during the pre-election period._

## [Team](https://digital-land.github.io/about/)

Adam our developer has left the team after a fantastic couple of years. Whilst we’re sad to see Adam go, we’re very happy to say that our new senior user researcher Stephanie has joined us, along with Rishi who will work on policy.

Paul and Natalie have been working with [Richard Pope](https://richardpope.org/) who has been helping us develop our strategy, in particular for planning.

Some of the team attended the [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org/) Summit. The day was packed with interesting, inspiring talks that were highly relevant to our team’s work.

A highlight was the keynote speaker’s, [Caroline Criado Perez](https://www.carolinecriadoperez.com/), talk on the impact gender biases in data have on women. Data more frequently uses the average male to represent the average human, leading to daily annoyances like long toilet queues or cold offices, to life-threatening implications such as women being 50% more likely to be misdiagnosed following a heart attack, or 17% more likely to die in a car crash. 

It was interesting to reflect, not only on the importance of accurate, trustworthy and representative data, but also on how we as the collectors, cleaners and publishers of data can influence its reliability.

In December, we had a great time at the digital directorate’s Christmas away day, filled with inspiring talks from our director Paul Maltby, as well as from policy and digital colleagues. We loved taking part in the unconference, addressing topics that ranged from how to include introverts in team discussions, to ways our department can minimise impact on climate change - a fantastic way to tailor the day around your interests! 

A huge thank you to our Corporate Office for organising a great day.

## [Brownfield Sites](https://digital-land.github.io/project/brownfield-sites/)

Adam and Colm have been developing ways to harmonise (automatically correct) common errors in a brownfield land register file, using the [brownfield validator](https://brownfield-sites-validator.herokuapp.com/). The validator can now show users a report breakdown of all errors in their register, which they can then fix. Several of these fixes are now automated, including the option to add missing headers, fix incorrect headers, and fix date formatting.

We’ve also extracted the validator code so that it can be reused elsewhere, for example in the register collector. This means we will be able to produce a report for all local planning authorities who publish their brownfield site register.

Emily and Lorna have been improving the [brownfield validator](https://brownfield-sites-validator.herokuapp.com/) content. Emily has also iterated the [brownfield guidance on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/brownfield-land-registers-data-standard/publish-your-brownfield-land-data) after receiving helpful feedback from local planning authorities who have used it to publish their register.

## [Developer contributions](https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/)

We selected 6 local planning authorities from 14 candidates to visit as a part of our user testing. These were selected to cover a variety of:

* volumes of contributions (CIL and S106 agreements)
* software providers and systems
* reporting responsibilities (joint, unitary, district, and county council)
* geographical locations

Our visits throughout November and December were extremely useful, providing insight into the complexity of developer contributions and how difficult it might be to fit information that frequently changes into a standardised data format. Some of the main learnings were that:

* people understand particular terms in ways which may differ from our own understanding
* in allowing people to make their own decisions when inputting data, such as creating a unique reference number, we can in fact make the task more difficult - being more specific is often more helpful
* local planning authorities might be interested in using the data for themselves to produce a dashboard
* it may be useful for local planning authorities to see examples of data, in order to better understand how to produce it
* contextual information about why certain fields are required, in the format that we have set,  and the purposes they serve, could be helpful
* it may not be possible for the status of CIL transactions to be reported in the current data model, because it cannot be tracked against a specific agreement or contribution
* it may not be useful to track in-kind contributions for Section 106 obligations using the current data model, because it doesn’t allow details to be attributed to the units

These were only a few of the many insights we're now analysing and learning from. Thank you to all the brilliant participants who offered their time to help us improve our services.

## [PropTech](https://digital-land.github.io/users/proptech/) 

Natalie and Jess ran a PropTech visit with the Minister of State for Housing at [Geovation](https://geovation.uk/), meeting with a variety of companies and hearing the perspective from several companies' clients. Alex Wrottesley was a tremendous host and we were also excited to [announce the new expert property innovation council](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/proptech-dragons-form-new-expert-property-innovation-council).

Jess also attended the launch of [London's Civic Innovation Challenge](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/arts-and-culture/mayor-londons-civic-innovation-challenge). She has been gathering perspectives from PropTech companies related to the build quality of new homes, and met with colleagues leading work in that area to hand over a summary of input from the past 2 months.
