Our updated brownfield site guidance is now on GOV.UK, along with updates to the validator. We’ve also published our discovery report on local plans, as well as our discovery and alpha report for the single register of planning.

## Team

Paul, Jake, Adam and Colm spent some time this week reviewing how we collect and analyse files published by local planning authorities. Paul sketched out a new structure for our website and repositories, which we’re now in the process of implementing, starting with our organisations pages.

## [Brownfield Sites](https://digital-land.github.io/project/brownfield-sites/)

Our updated [guidance on publishing brownfield land data](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/brownfield-land-registers-data-standard/publish-your-brownfield-land-data) is now live on GOV.UK. This is a clearer, simplified version of the [old data standard](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/653657/BrownfieldLandRegisters_-_DataStandard.pdf).

Adam and Colm have been updating our [brownfield site data validator](http://brownfield-sites-validator.herokuapp.com/) which local planning authorities can use alongside our guidance to check the accuracy of their data. 

We believe the new guidance and validator will encourage local planning authorities to publish more accurate, up to date, publically available data on a more frequent basis.

## [Developer contributions](https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/)
Helena and Lorna have spent this week writing user stories for each of the areas of the infrastructure funding statement legislation. They have also been developing workshop materials ahead of visiting each of the authorities participating in our private beta. 

## Project pages

Helena, Michael and Emily have published the [local plans discovery report](https://digital-land.github.io/project/local-plans/discovery), as well as the [single register of planning discovery and alpha report](https://digital-land.github.io/project/single-register-of-planning/discovery/), both of which they’ve rewritten as website content.

Jake has helped redesign the project pages to reflect different phases of each project’s lifecycle. This will help to ensure content remains up to date and is not deleted.
