Brownfield sites are plots of land that have previously been developed but are not currently in use. [Recent analysis](https://www.cpre.org.uk/resources/housing-and-planning/planning/item/5086-state-of-brownfield-2019) suggests more than 1 million houses could be built on brownfield sites across England.

We're working with local planning authorities to improve the quality and availability of data on brownfield sites. We're currently building and testing several resources to help local planning authorities publish and update their data. Join the conversation on our [GitHub issues pages](https://github.com/digital-land/digital-land/labels/project%3Abrownfield-sites) if you're interested in brownfield site data.
