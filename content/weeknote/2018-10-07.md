## Team

It’s been a rollercoaster of a week for the Digital Land team. Sadly, we’ve said goodbye to Ed, our brilliant policy lead, who is moving upstairs to start his new job as Private Secretary to the Permanent Secretary - a bit of a tongue twister, but a brilliant role. Whilst we’re sad to see him go, we’re proud to have a Digital Land alumni working in the upper ranks of MHCLG!
