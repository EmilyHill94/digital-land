To complete step 2 you must be able to edit (or create) your local authority’s brownfield sites web page. If you aren’t able or authorised to do this, speak to someone who is (this might be the person who updates your local planning authority’s developer contribution or planning application web pages).

Upload the brownfield site CSV file to your local planning authority's website using a [persistent URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_uniform_resource_locator) (a web address that will not change over time). For example, Norfolk’s local planning authority might use the following persistent URL (this is an example, not live data):

https://www.norfolk.gov.uk/brownfield-site.csv

When you upload the file you should:

* keep your older files online – it’s important to retain a history of all brownfield site files
* the newest version of the brownfield data file should be called brownfield-site.csv 
* the previous version should be kept and renamed brownfield-site-YYYYMMDD.csv, with the actual date in place of YYYYMMDD (for example brownfield-site-20190731.csv)

You should then update your local planning authority’s brownfield sites web page to make the CSV files publicly available. If your website does not have a page on brownfield sites, you or someone in the web team will need to create one.

The page must list the persistent URL as defined above. The URLs must be written out in full. The URL should not change. However, if it ever does change, you must tell us.
