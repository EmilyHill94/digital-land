The energy performance of buildings (EPB) team within the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) Digital Directorate have been building a new online service to help users find an energy certificate, or to find an energy assessor. Part of this journey is to find an [energy performance certificate (EPC)](https://www.gov.uk/buy-sell-your-home/energy-performance-certificates).

The team recently passed their GDS alpha assessment and are moving into beta, testing and iterating the current prototype.

The [existing EPC register](https://www.epcregister.com/) has a complex user journey. Simplifying this journey and the online content will help users complete their tasks more easily.
