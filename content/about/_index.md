### Who we are
We’re a team of digital and policy specialists in the [Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-housing-communities-and-local-government).

### Our mission
By making land and housing data easier to find, use and trust, we aim to make it easier for everyone involved in land and housing development to make better informed decisions, for communities to better understand and know how to engage with decisions around development in their area, and for PropTech developers to create new digital services for the marketplace. We’re also working to make it easier for local authorities to record decisions and report data, freeing up their limited resources.

### Our vision
We are developing a suite of free digital services that will help unlock land and housing data’s potential for everyone involved in land and housing development. Improving data will help open up the housing market to smaller businesses and help transform the relationship between planners, developers and communities.

Our digital design service for policymakers will help them get the land and housing data they need to make decisions, while making it easy for local authorities to record decisions and report that data and for anyone with an interest in land and housing development to find, use and trust it.

### How we work
We work as a digital team, meaning we develop our services iteratively, using agile methodology. This means we start with a minimum viable service and add features on according to validated user needs, based on user research. We test everything we make with users until we’re satisfied it meets those needs. We build in small increments, which reduces risk.
