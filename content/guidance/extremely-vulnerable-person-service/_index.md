## Overview

The information on this page is for local authorities receiving data on clinically extremely vulnerable people who require support during Covid-19. 

Local authority hubs receive 3 types of data: 

1. Data collected from the extremely vulnerable person’s service, via GOV.UK form or phone line(should be receiving daily)
2. NHS patient data (should have received 2 files)
3. Wholesaler data on the delivery status of food parcels 

Hubs access the first 2 types of data via their online account. The third type of data, wholesaler data, is emailed to hub data leads.

Hubs then share this data with the local authorities within their hub.
