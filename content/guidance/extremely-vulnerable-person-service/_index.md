## Introduction

The information on this page is for local authorities receiving data on clinically extremely vulnerable people who may require support during Covid-19.

### Types of data

Local authority hubs currently receive 3 types of data, which they should share with local authorities within their hub:

1. Daily incoming data on people who have applied for support – new file at 4pm every day
2. NHS patient data – currently 2 files
3. Wholesaler food delivery data – new files weekly 

Local authorities will soon receive a fourth set of data. This will have information on NHS patients who the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) have been unable to contact. We will provide more information on this soon.

### Access the data

Hubs access the first 2 datasets on their [GOV.​UK transfer data account](https://transfer-coronavirus-data.service.gov.uk/).

Hubs currently access the wholesaler data through MiCollab, a separate online account (URL beginning “micollab.joinedupdclg.net”). However, this will soon change and hubs will be able to access all the data from the GOV.UK account.

### Issues accessing data: hubs

If you are a hub and have not received either the daily incoming data or the NHS patient data, or if you have issues accessing your GOV.UK transfer data account, email [transfer-coronavirus-data-service@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](transfer-coronavirus-data-service@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk). 

If you are a hub and have not received wholesaler data, or have issues accessing your MiCollab account, email [sheilding@communties.gov.uk](sheilding@communties.gov.uk).

### Issues accessing data: local authorities who are not a hub

[Contact your hub](https://digital-land.github.io/organisation/shielding-hub) to receive your data.

If you do not have an email contact for your hub, please email [DigitalLand@communities.gov.uk](DigitalLand@communities.gov.uk) and we will send you contact details for your hub.

### Add a data lead for your local authority hub

Each local authority hub can have multiple data leads. Email [transfer-coronavirus-data-service@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](transfer-coronavirus-data-service@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) with the new person’s:

* first name
* last name
* mobile number
* email address
