MHCLG will [subject to this consultation] maintain a national register of developer contributions in a file called developer-contribution-register.csv

All organisations with a statutory duty to publish their own registers of contributions should ensure that the following columns in this file are kept accurate and up to date:

**name**

Find your organisation in the alphabetised list.

**register-url**

Enter the web address of the web page created in step 2.

{{% inset-text %}}
Date fields refer to the recording of the data rather than when agreements come into effect or end â€“ read our data principles on dates for more information.
{{% /inset-text %}}

**entry-date**

**start-date**

Enter the date the registry was first created, in the format described in the entry-date column.

**end-date**

Enter the date the registry will no longer be valid, in the format described in the entry-date column.
