_We updated the guidance on GOV.UK for publishing brownfield land registers, improved the data pages on this site, and published discovery reports for the local plans, and single register of planning projects._

## [Brownfield Sites](https://digital-land.github.io/project/brownfield-sites/)

We have updated the [guidance on publishing brownfield land data](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/brownfield-land-registers-data-standard/publish-your-brownfield-land-data) on GOV.UK.

Data produced following this new guidance is [backwards-compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility) with the [old standard](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/653657/BrownfieldLandRegisters_-_DataStandard.pdf), but we have made some changes to the format:

* We [deprecated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation#Software_deprecation) a number of redundant fields.
* We made a number of fields which our research showed weren't understood by publishers, or useful to users, optional.
* We combined 6 separate description fields into a single "Notes" field.
* We cited the mandated open standards for government [exchange of location point](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/exchange-of-location-point) for coordinates, meaning they're easier to create, and can be used directly by Web mapping services such as Google, Bing, and OpenStreetMaps

Most importantly, we have clarified the same publication should be updated more frequently, rather than creating a new publication each year, and sites which have been developed should remain in the register, but marked in a new "EndDate" field.

Adam and Colm have been updating our [brownfield site data validator](http://brownfield-sites-validator.herokuapp.com/) to match our changes to the guidance. Our research told us how people using validators often feel demotivated, like they've just failed a test. So we've been experimenting with ways of presenting the results, telling people what they need to do to fix an issue, rather than just saying what's wrong.

We've also begun to [collect brownfield land](https://github.com/digital-land/brownfield-sites-collection) data each night, and show the results on this site. This will help us test the performance of our work; if we're succeeding in helping local planning authorities publish better data and more frequently.

## [Compulsory Purchase Orders](https://digital-land.github.io/project/compulsory-purchase-orders/)
We introduced our work at the Digital Showcase, which included Tom presenting the policy, remotely, and Matt giving a live demonstration of our prototype dashboard.
Matt and Lorna held a workshop with Tom and the policy team to find ways improving the data we hold about the CPO process, using insights from testing the dashboard with users.

## [Developer contributions](https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/)
Helena and Lorna have spent this week writing user stories for each of the areas of the infrastructure funding statement legislation. They have also been developing workshop materials ahead of visiting each of the authorities participating in our private beta.

## Team

Helena, Michael, Emily and Jake redesigned the project pages to reflect different phases of each project’s life cycle, making it easier to read, and simpler for us to maintain without losing the history of each project.  This meant we could finally publish the [local plans discovery report](https://digital-land.github.io/project/local-plans/discovery), and the [single register of planning discovery and alpha report](https://digital-land.github.io/project/single-register-of-planning/discovery/) on our project pages.

Paul, Jake, Adam and Colm spent some time this week reviewing how we collect and analyse files published by local planning authorities. Paul sketched out a new structure for our website and repositories, which we’re now in the process of implementing, starting with our [organisation](https://digital-land.github.io/organisation/) pages.

Paul has begun contributing to a [wikidata project](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata_talk:WikiProject_UK_and_Ireland/adm/England) to help us link to local authority websites, and information about development corporations and other organisations which don't appear in government registers.

## Policy

Natalie and Jess have been inundated with project planning issues, new commissions, and other tasks this week ahead of the pre-election period.
We expect [purdah](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/election-guidance-for-civil-servants) to apply sometime next week,
which means these will be our last weeknotes for some time to come.
