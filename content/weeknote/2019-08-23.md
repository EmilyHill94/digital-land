It's August, and some of the team have been seconded to lend their digital skills to another project in the department, but still quite a busy week for those of us left in the office. Natalie, Ed and Paul been involved in preparing papers and participating in discussions on a number of different policy areas, which we can't talk about publicly, yet. We also begun investigating two new projects related to building regulations.

Matt has been working with our friends in the [developer contributions](https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/) policy team on how we can support pilot authorities, and workshops planned for when the regulations come into force in September. Soon!

Our work on [Compulsory Purchase Orders](https://digital-land.github.io/project/compulsory-purchase-orders/) (CPOs) has picked up pace. Matt visited the Planning Inspectorate in Bristol with our policy specialist Tom and colleagues from the Planning Caseworker Unit they discussed progress and how we plan to open up historical data and the process for keeping it up to date. Colm made changes to the [prototype dashboard](https://github.com/digital-land/cpos-prototype) following feedback from the meeting and continued to work with the historical data and documents.  Lorna continued the user research, interviewing people interested in CPO data from the PropTech sector and acquiring authorities.

As well as projects and policy work, we've also been  on the digital land service itself, which is nearing the end of our alpha phase. Paul revamped the wall to reflect our understanding of the ecosystem, and Helena and Lorna have been shaping our collection of hypotheses. Jake has been evolving the architecture of the collection pipeline and investigating ways of mapping data into a consistent shape, starting with harmonising the multitude of different file formats we have collected for [brownfield sites](https://digital-land.github.io/project/brownfield-sites/).
