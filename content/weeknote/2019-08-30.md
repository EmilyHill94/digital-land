A short but busy week for those of us still in the office in August. The nature of policy often makes it hard for us to talk publicly about some of the bigger things which have occupied much of the team's focus. That was truer than ever this week. 

Jess, Natalie and Ed met with the [Geospatial Commission](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/geospatial-commission), and the newly formed Real Estate Data Foundation about our priorities. Dan Hughes, aka @<a href="https://twitter.com/PropertyDanH/">PropertyDanH</a>, visited Jess in the office, and tweeted a photo of our walls.

Paul continued to speak to users this week, hearing from an early stage banking platform and a planning consultant with a strong nouse for data. Paul and Natalie visited <a href="https://vu.city/">VU/CITY</a> where Paul and Jason showed them how their 3D model transforms the experience for developers and planners, and helped us better understand their needs for data. We were pleased to <a href="https://geospatialcommission.blog.gov.uk/2019/08/28/vu-city-bringing-planning-into-the-community/">hear they have begun working</a> with our friends at <a href="https://colouringlondon.org/">Colouring London</a>.

Emily and Michael have been finalising our guidance which will be published on GOV.UK ahead of the new [developer contributions](https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/) regulation coming into force next month. Helena and Matt have begun to work on how developer contributions data can help local planning authorities complete their <a href="https://github.com/digital-land/digital-land/issues/222">infrastructure funding statement</a>.  We're planning to use this site and GitHub issues as one of the ways of handling feedback during beta as we did with the consultation (alpha) phase.

Although not on a gov.uk domain, and clearly sign-posted as being a prototype, not using [transport typeface](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/11/can-i-use-the-gov-uk-fonts/), we were still concerned our use of the GOV.UK style could let people confuse these pages as being officially a part of the single-domain for government. So after some thought, Colm removed the crown from the header. We hope that's made it clearer. But we'll continue to test this and our other assumptions with our users, natch.

Helena has also been looking how we can improve the project pages on this site. We're considering having different shaped pages for each phase, necessitated in part by our [local plans discovery](https://digital-land.github.io/project/local-plans/) discovery potentially leading to several different projects.

Work continues on [Compulsory Purchase Orders](https://digital-land.github.io/project/compulsory-purchase-orders/) (CPOs). Matt has been investigating approaches for redacting the planning documents we intend to publish. Rather than build an information service, we'd like to publish the documents on GOV.UK in a similar way to [Air Accidents Investigation Branch reports](https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports) or [Drug Device Alerts](https://www.gov.uk/drug-device-alerts) which allow users to facet and search within a collection. That seems to involve our speaking [to colleagues in GDS](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/organising-and-grouping-content-on-gov-uk).  Lorna been analysing interviews with users creating and using CPOs, pulling out key points onto sticky notes and affinity mapping with help from Stephanie. We'd still trying to speak to people from local authorities with less experience of CPOs.

Jake has continued to work on a pipeline to harmonise different file formats and data models. Working with [brownfield sites](https://digital-land.github.io/project/brownfield-sites/) files, his [data-fixer](https://github.com/digital-land/data-fixer-prototype/blob/master/index.js#L48) illustrates just how messy this data is, and the work necessary to build a national dataset. There's a snapshot of the output in a [gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jakemulley/9e2a078f2e5556e967ec24b73c87e9cd/raw/0aff13d851ae7a66543b11f98f8980457ed464f3/data-fixer-prototype%2520-%2520brownfield%2520site%2520pre-validation).

Finally, although in reality two quite distinct individuals, Emily and Natalie have realised why some people keep mixing them up!
