Brownfield sites are plots of land that have previously been developed but are not currently in use. [Recent analysis](https://www.cpre.org.uk/resources/housing-and-planning/planning/item/5086-state-of-brownfield-2019) suggests more than 1 million houses could be built on brownfield sites across England.

The Digital Land team is working with local planning authorities to improve the quality and availability of data on brownfield sites across England. We've created resources to help local planning authorities publish and update their brownfield site data. See the project's current areas of investigation to learn more about our ongoing efforts to improve the data and how to get involved in the discussion about brownfield sites.

## Resources for planning authorities


### Update your brownfield site data: guidance

Follow [these simple instructions](https://digital-land.github.io/guidance/brownfield-sites/) when adding new brownfield sites to their registers.


### Check your brownfield site data for errors

Our validator will [check your brownfield site data](https://brownfield-sites-validator.cloudapps.digital/start) for common errors and omissions and fix them. A comparison of data quality for [brownfield registers that have been checked](https://digital-land.github.io/brownfield-sites/) is also available.


### View brownfield site registers

[View brownfield site data](https://github.com/communitiesuk/digital-land-collector/tree/master/data/publication/brownfield-sites) by local authority.

## Current areas of investigation

The following areas of investigation explore how the data could be used and made easier to work with:

#### Questions we're asking

Brownfield site data for local authorities can be difficult to locate and there’s no public register where all LA’s data can be viewed in one place. Would creating a national index of all brownfield data be of value to local authorities and interested members of the community?

#### What we tested
* a simple [index of brownfield site registers](https://github.com/communitiesuk/digital-land-collector/blob/master/etc/brownfield-site-publication.tsv)

#### What we've learned

We made a number of useful observations while compiling the simple index, including that:

* planning authorities often failed to provide a direct link to the data (ie to a policy page instead)
* when some registers were updated their URLs changed (ie they're not static)
* registers were often published in formats other than .csv (eg Excel files)
* registers often contained gaps or errors

#### Questions we're asking

Often the person in the local authority updating the brownfield site data has little or no spare time, has varied responsibilities and is not familiar with the brownfield data format. As a result errors are common in brownfield data. Would offering a simple tool for validating the data improve this?

#### What we tested
* a [validation tool](https://brownfield-sites-validator.cloudapps.digital/) for brownfield site data

#### What we've learned

We tested the tool with some local planning authorities whose brownfield site data contained errors. They were able to use the tool to identify the error, correct and republish it.

{{< /prototype-heading >}}

#### Questions we're asking

Many of the errors we identified in published brownfield data were common mistakes, such as switching GeoX and GeoY coordinates, or omitting empty rows in the data. Would offering to automatically fix common errors after validating the data be useful to LAs and improve the state of data?

#### What we tested
* a [validation tool](https://brownfield-sites-validator.cloudapps.digital/) for brownfield sites

#### What we've learned

We spoke with many of those in local authorities who are responsible for publishing the data. Often they were not technically trained or experienced with working with data. We tested the validator with some of these users, many of whom were able to spot and correct the data errors.

## Timeline

**4 April 2019**

We met with [CPRE](https://cpre.org.uk/) to understand more about how they collected the brownfield data, the challenges they faced, and how they used the data.

**March 2019**

The [Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE)](https://cpre.org.uk/) published the [2019 State of Brownfield annual report](https://www.cpre.org.uk/resources/housing-and-planning/planning/item/5086-state-of-brownfield-2019). In the report they highlighted some of the challenges they faced whilst collecting brownfield data.

**Summer 2018**

We built a [register of all the brownfield registers](https://github.com/communitiesuk/digital-land-collector/blob/master/etc/brownfield-site-publication.tsv) and prototyped a tool to [validate the data](https://brownfield-sites-validator.cloudapps.digital/).
