The National Planning Policy Framework requires all local planning authorities and certain other organisations to [publish their developer contributions data](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/planning-obligations#are-planning-obligation-contributions-required-by-local-planning-authorities-publically-available) on a regular basis and in an agreed format. That format hasn’t yet been agreed, but the following guidance is a working approach that we plan to refine with your input.

Our aim is to develop a data format and publishing guidance that results in better insights into how developer contributions are supporting community infrastructure. But we also want a standard that causes as little disruption as possible to your existing processes.

## Make your data findable, useable and trustworthy

Developer contributions include Section 106, community infrastructure levies (CIL), Section 78 and Section 73. The data on these has a wide range of current and potential uses, including:

* planning land and housing development
* creating new digital services
* giving community members insight into local development and how they can influence it

But for data to be useful it must be easy to find, use, understand and trust.

Local planning authorities can ensure that their developer contributions data is all of these by following an agreed specification for how to format, label and publish it. The following guidance gives a high-level overview of our draft specification and the publication process.

## Publishing developer contributions: 3 steps

Planning authorities must publish their developer contributions once a year but are encouraged to do so as frequently as they can so that datasets are up to date. (Those publishing with third-party software that can semi-automate the process might be able to publish in near real-time, for example, while those publishing manually might choose to only publish quarterly.)

This guidance applies to the publication of developer contributions data going forward – you are not required to republish historical data so that it complies with this guidance. 

Publishing is a 3 step process:

1. Three developer contribution .csv files must be created to store the data
2. Each of these files must be uploaded to your organisation’s website and clearly linked to using a persistent URL
3. The national register of developer contributions on the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) website must be kept up to date
