MHCLG will maintain a national register of developer contributions.

The first time you create and publish your 3 CSV files you must tell us where these are published (the persistent URL created in step 2). You must also tell us if this ever changes.

We will update this guidance soon with instructions on how to tell us. If you'd like to share your data now or have any questions, email us at DigitalLand@communities.gov.uk
