_This sprint we’ve done a lot of work on local plans, and Paul has written guidance on finding the local authority from an address._

## [Team](https://digital-land.github.io/about/)

We’re sad to see our developer Jake leave the team for a new role at the Ministry of Justice. He’ll be missed by us. However, we’ve already sifted some great applications for his replacement.

We’ve had 2 show and tells this sprint. Ben Duckworth, who works with Natalie on Digital Planning, attended our team show and tell, and we’re looking forward to working closely with Ben. Some of the team also held a show and tell with Minister Pincher, covering the activity of the Digital Land team and the data, policy and PropTech work underway.
