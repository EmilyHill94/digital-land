The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) will maintain a national register of brownfield sites.

The first time you create and publish your CSV file you must tell us where this is published (the persistent URL created in step 2). You must also tell us if this URL ever changes.

Email the URL you created in step 2 to DigitalLand@communities.gov.uk and we will add them to the national register.

You will soon be able to submit the URL through an online tool the Digital Land team are developing. When this is ready, the team will make an announcement on the [Digital Land blog](https://digital-land.github.io/blog-post/) and this guidance will be updated.

! If have any questions or feedback, please fill out this feedback form or email DigitalLand@communities.gov.uk
