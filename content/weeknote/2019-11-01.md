_We updated the guidance on GOV.UK for publishing brownfield land registers, improved the data pages on this site, and published discovery reports for the local plans, and single register of planning projects._

## [Brownfield Sites](https://digital-land.github.io/project/brownfield-sites/)

Our updated [guidance on publishing brownfield land data](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/brownfield-land-registers-data-standard/publish-your-brownfield-land-data) is now live on GOV.UK. This is compatible with the [old data standard](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/653657/BrownfieldLandRegisters_-_DataStandard.pdf), but with some important clarifications.

Adam and Colm have been updating our [brownfield site data validator](http://brownfield-sites-validator.herokuapp.com/) which local planning authorities can use alongside our guidance to check their data meets the standard, and can be used by PropTech and other users.

We've also begun to [collect brownfield land](https://github.com/digital-land/brownfield-sites-collection) data each night, and show the results on this site. This will help us test the performance of our work to help local planning authorities to publish better data more frequently.

## [Compulsory Purchase Orders](https://digital-land.github.io/project/compulsory-purchase-orders/)
Matt and Lorna held a workshop with Tom and the policy team to find ways improving the data we hold about the CPO process, using insights from testing our prototype dashboard with users.

## [Developer contributions](https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/)
Helena and Lorna have spent this week writing user stories for each of the areas of the infrastructure funding statement legislation. They have also been developing workshop materials ahead of visiting each of the authorities participating in our private beta.

## Team

Helena, Michael and Emily have published the [local plans discovery report](https://digital-land.github.io/project/local-plans/discovery), as well as the [single register of planning discovery and alpha report](https://digital-land.github.io/project/single-register-of-planning/discovery/), both of which they’ve rewritten as website content.

Jake has helped redesign the project pages to reflect different phases of each project’s life cycle. This will help to ensure content remains up to date and is not deleted.

Paul, Jake, Adam and Colm spent some time this week reviewing how we collect and analyse files published by local planning authorities. Paul sketched out a new structure for our website and repositories, which we’re now in the process of implementing, starting with our [organisation](https://digital-land.github.io/organisation/) pages.
To avoid us having to keep track of local authority websites, and information about development corporations which don't appear in government registers, Paul has begun contributing to a [wikidata project](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata_talk:WikiProject_UK_and_Ireland/adm/England).

These will be our last weeknotes until December as we expect [purdah](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/election-guidance-for-civil-servants) to apply next week.
