This week we held the local plans steering group to present the finding from Paul and Helena's discovery work to internal stakeholders. 
After a positive reception and discussion we're now planning the next steps of the project as we prepare to move into an Alpha phase.

Matt has continued his work on Compulsory Purchase Orders (CPOs) and has plans for a proposed model that will be published on our project page early next week. 
Lorna is also forming a user research plan for CPOs so if you are interested in speaking to us please contact us at digitalland@communities.gov.uk.

Natalie and Ed have now completed  an introductory pack for our new Minister following the cabinet reshuffle this week. 
They have also been developing a short term programme for our work so that we are closely aligned with the wider departmental strategy.
