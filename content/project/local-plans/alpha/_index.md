summary: We’re working with local planning authorities to design an improved format for publishing local plan data so that it’s easy to find, use and trust.

In March 2020, we opened an [supplier opportunity](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/digital-outcomes-and-specialists/opportunities/11591) on Digital Marketplace to work on the Local Plans alpha phase. It was awarded to [dxw digital](https://www.dxw.com/).

The alpha tested ideas for the better use of data held about, and within local plans.

## What we've learned

Through developing a data standard for local plan timetables and policies, and prototyping ways of presenting that data, policy makers, planning inspectors and local planning authorities collectively recognise the value of the datasets.

A data standard for plan timetables and categories is useful, but the opportunities are really realised with a common language for describing data about, and within, policies.

By making available and presenting the data to users in different ways, they can meet existing needs easily and with greater confidence.

Plan and policy data is a vital and fundamental component of the emerging national data infrastructure for planning.

## The opportunities

A data standard for local plans and an accessible way to access the data can open up huge opportunities, including:

* a national picture of of plan making
* a useful picture of where a plan is in its development
* better collaboration (formal and informal) between Local Planning Authorities
* more options to connect with the content in local plans
* intelligent mapping of planning decisions to policies
* open data on development policies for others to build services on (PropTech)

## Prototypes

* A data standard: [data tables](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qo9qGum20Xnt_BTXgpW1eNEfPp_hZU9H6bJcP4O1pSg/edit?usp=sharing) and [guidance for publishing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUc-Flk0TAnH8e9Gw3m7WetL9ZMx5eFRIkHcV9Lh2Y/edit?usp=sharing).

* [Version 1](https://local-plan.herokuapp.com/v1) of the prototype focuses on an exemplar local plan page for local authorities, including a policy data table. It was tested with 3 local planning authorities.

* [Version 2](https://local-plan.herokuapp.com/v2) of the prototype focuses on plan data (including plan timetables) at the national level and for individual planning authorities. It was tested with 5 (PINS and MHCLG) participants.

* [Version 3](https://local-plan.herokuapp.com/v3) of the prototype includes a national dataset page on plans and policies, timetable overview, an overview and details page for a local planning authority and guidance on publishing plan data. It was tested with 5 local planning authorities.

## Recommendations

We recommend a private beta to test those elements of the project that are critical to the success of a national roll-out by working with users on a real version of the service. The beta should:

* be tested in some real local geographies using groups of LPAs with shared objectives but different plans, policies, skills, resources and digital capacity
* answer important questions about categories, resources, managing GIS data and the amount of time required from LPAs
* involve a wider group of stakeholders including infrastructure providers, proptech companies and councillors
* create answers to the question “what’s in it for me?” asked by LPAs and test the hypothesis that the extra work of providing more than just plan production dates is outweighed by better evidence and decisions
