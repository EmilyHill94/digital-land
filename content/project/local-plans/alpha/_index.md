summary: We’re working with local planning authorities to design an improved format for publishing local plan data so that it’s easy to find, use and trust.

In March 2020, we opened a [supplier opportunity](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/digital-outcomes-and-specialists/opportunities/11591) on Digital Marketplace to work on the local plans alpha phase. It was awarded to [dxw digital](https://www.dxw.com/).

The alpha tested ideas for the better use of data held within, and about local plans. Data _within_ local plans is information contained in a plan, such as the number of houses a local authority plans to build. An example of data _about_ local plans might be an overview of when each local planning authority last published theirs.

## Outputs

Dxw designed a data standard for local plans, as well as guidance on how to publish the data. They also designed and tested 3 prototypes to visualise data about and within local plans.

### [Data standard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qo9qGum20Xnt_BTXgpW1eNEfPp_hZU9H6bJcP4O1pSg/edit?usp=sharing) 

A data standard improves the quality, consistency and usefulness of data published about local plans. This data standard is based on the brownfield land and developer contributions data standards, developed by the Digital Land team. 

### [Guidance for publishing local plans data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUc-Flk0TAnH8e9Gw3m7WetL9ZMx5eFRIkHcV9Lh2Y/edit?usp=sharing)

Clear, accessible guidance is important to help local planning authorities publish their data in accordance with the standard. This guidance builds on the Digital Land team’s existing [data standards and guidance](https://digital-land.github.io/guidance/).

### [Prototype 1: a local authority’s local plan page](https://local-plan.herokuapp.com/v1)

This design was an example of a local plan page for local authorities, including a policy data table. 

It was tested with 3 local planning authorities, and has been invaluable in understanding where there is common language. This helped show some of the constraints around standardisation. Local plans necessarily respond to local needs, and the flexibility in their production is a strength of the system. However, this strength makes standardisation challenging.

Watch [dxw’s first show and tell](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BPeaV5t7rQQkbWN36k25V2sB5uDu1wPQ/view?usp=sharing) for further details about this prototype and learnings from the user testing.

### [Prototype 2: a national picture of local plans](https://local-plan.herokuapp.com/v2)

This prototype showed plan data (including plan timetables) at both the national level, and for individual planning authorities. 

It was tested with 5 participants from the Planning Inspectorate (PINS) and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG). This helped to explore how a national picture of plan-making could be presented on the web, for example by a particular geography (not necessarily a local authority boundary).

### [Prototype 3: helping authorities use and submit local plan data](https://local-plan.herokuapp.com/v3)

This prototype pulls together several of the alpha outputs, including the:

* national dataset of plans and policies (the “View plan data” web page)
* timetable overview for all current and emerging local plans
* downloadable development plan document data, and policy data
* web page with details for each local planning authority’s local plan data
* guidance for local planning authorities on how to publish their local plan data

It was tested with 5 local planning authorities.

Watch [dxw’s third show and tell](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BPeaV5t7rQQkbWN36k25V2sB5uDu1wPQ/view?usp=sharing) for further details about this prototype and learnings from the user testing.

## Learnings

### Data standard
A data standard for local plan timetables and policies improves the how information about local plans can be communicated to communities and central government.. 

### Common language
Whilst a data standard for plan timetables and policy categories is useful, the greatest value of a data standard is creating a common language for describing policies.

Many terms have very specific meanings, but those meanings can be different in different contexts. Examples of words that have caused confusion in user research are ‘area’, ‘strategic’, ‘supplementary’, ‘policy’, ‘evidence’, ‘status’ and ‘commitment’. It is important to use language that makes sense to all users of the data.

### Presenting the data
Presenting local plans data in a variety of clear, accessible formats, will help policymakers, planning inspectors, and local planning authorities recognise the value of the data. This will also help them to use the data more easily, and with greater confidence.

### Importance of the data
Local plan and policy data is a vital and fundamental part of the emerging national data infrastructure for planning.

## Opportunities

A data standard for local plans and an accessible way to access the data can open up important opportunities, including:

* a national picture of plan making
* an understanding  of where an individual plan is in its development
* better collaboration (formal and informal) between neighbouring local planning authorities
* more options to communicate content within local plans
* intelligent mapping of planning decisions to policies
* open data on development policies for others to build services on (such as PropTech)

## Recommendations

The team recommends a private beta to test parts of the project that are critical to the success of a national local plan dataset, and to test a real version of the service with users. The beta should:

* be tested in some real local geographies using groups of local planning authorities with shared objectives but different plans, policies, skills, resources and digital capacity
* answer important questions about categories, resources, managing GIS data and the amount of time required from local planning authorities
* involve a wider group of stakeholders including infrastructure providers, proptech companies and councillors
* create answers to the question “what’s in it for me?” asked by local planning authorities and test the hypothesis that the extra work of providing more than just plan production dates is outweighed by better evidence and decisions

This will only work if local planning authorities see the value, which the beta must focus on.
