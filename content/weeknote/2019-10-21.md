Our week started well with a PropTech round table event. The Minister of State for Housing and Planning, Esther McVey, saw demonstrations of 5 digital products and then chaired a discussion with 12 PropTech companies. The Minister, who supports our strategy, announced several Digital Land projects:

* opening up [compulsory purchase orders](https://digital-land.github.io/project/compulsory-purchase-orders/) data for the first time to improve transparency
* enabling PropTech companies to access more data such as energy performance certificates, and the square footage information of properties
* the introduction of a national index of brownfield sites, simplifying and improving the quality of data from brownfield land registers to help developers to find brownfield land to build on
* to work with the PropTech industry to continue to help open up data held by local authorities

So far the response from those who took part has been positive. The announcement featured 8 industry and national press articles. A huge thanks to Natalie, Jess and Alice for all their hard work arranging the event.

## [Brownfield sites](https://digital-land.github.io/project/brownfield-sites/)

Jake and Paul reviewed the specification alongside the data published by local authorities.. After some discussion with policy colleagues, we decided to simplify the specification, making more fields optional. Emily and Michael updated our draft of the [new guidance](https://digital-land.github.io/guidance/brownfield-sites/) which we have begun to test with users. The guidance is written in a similar style to the developer contributions guidance we published last month.. 

## [Developer contributions](https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/)

Helena, Lorna and Matt held a workshop with policy colleagues to map out how the legislation for completing the infrastructure funding statement (IFS) translates as a data output in relation to our model for publishing developer contributions data. We want to test whether we can use the 3 csv files to populate the IFS report.

Helena completed the screening process users to test with for our private beta. We will be meeting with 6 local authorities whilst they follow our guidance to publish their developer contributions data.

## [Compulsory purchase orders](https://digital-land.github.io/project/compulsory-purchase-orders/)

Lorna analysed the findings from the usability lab sessions where we tested the compulsory purchase orders prototype. The response from users was very positive and we learned some interesting and useful insights, which Lorna presented to the team. For example, we observed that users had a different understanding of when a case was ‚Äúclosed‚Äù. We also heard different perceptions from users around whether CPO cases should be categorised by ‚Äútype‚Äù, ‚Äúpower‚Äù or ‚Äúlegislation‚Äù. Together, the project team agreed the areas to change and what the next steps should be.
