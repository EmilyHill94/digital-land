We started the week on a bit of a high with the announcement Sunday morning of [new planning rules](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/communities-to-see-how-housing-developers-cash-benefits-them-thanks-to-new-planning-rules) intended help local people better understand the development. This included our new [guidance on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/publish-your-developer-contributions-data) for publishing developer contributions as data. There's still a lot more we can do to simplify the publishing process for local planning authorities, and to iron a few wrinkles in the guidance. Not least, we need to be clearer on the copyright and licensing terms for the published data. All the same, this is the culmination of a year's work with the planning policy team and the wider community, and is something for us to celebrate.

We're now in process of selecting local planning authorities to work with on a private beta phase,
and Lorna and Helena made a form to send out to people who showed interest at our workshops.

Our helping produce an [infrastructure funding statement](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/community-infrastructure-levy#para17) is one of the benefits to local planning authorities of publishing developer contributions data. Helena and Lorna have also begun to collect hypothesis for this report we'll test, starting with our imagined user-flow, sketched out by Matt.

Data standards take time to develop, regulation takes time to enact and enforce. Paul drew a sketch to illustrate how data being devolved makes collecting it sustainably difficult, and take longer to make available nationally. This has concentrated our minds somewhat, and we're now working on ways of demonstrating value more quickly, including better coping with collecting data as it currently exists, in different states of maturity.

On Monday, Paul Maltby, our Chief Digital Officer, joined Paul and Natalie on a visit to the City of London. They met with the Land Registry team to hear about their recent work with the City and the <a href="https://search-local-land-charges.service.gov.uk/">Local Land Charges Service</a>. We explored the differences between the needs of conveyancers using the service to transact on a single property, and the needs of our PropTech users who generally need the data in bulk, and in some cases need access to the original documents, not just the data.

Colm and Adam continued work on a dashboard for [Compulsory Purchase Orders](https://digital-land.github.io/project/compulsory-purchase-orders/) (CPOs), improving the filtering, giving users more options, based on the feedback collected from the policy team. In particular they have speeded up some of the queries.  Lorna gave a feedback session on her research into users of CPOs following 13 interviews with people in acquiring authorities, practitioners and representatives of PropTech. We think this work is at a point we can test the dashboard and our hypotheses in a lab.

We've been revamping our walls, so Paul made physical [Kanban cards](https://digital-land.github.io/project-kanban-cards/) for each of our projects, including prospective projects we've prioritised and have begun to investigate.

Jess, Natalie, and Ed have been understanding the options for procuring tools to support potential future pilot projects in the department, and met with the Crown Commercial Service. Jess also had a fun visit from [Antony Slumbers](https://twitter.com/antonyslumbers) to share the work we've been doing and talk about innovations in the residential market.

Finally, Natalie and Paul visited City Hall at the invitation of Peter Kemp and Molly Strauss of the GLA for a regular catch-up where we compared notes with [Connected Cities Catapult](https://futurecities.catapult.org.uk/), [Plan-X](https://www.planx.uk/), and digital planning projects in Camden, Hackney, Southwark and Westminster.
