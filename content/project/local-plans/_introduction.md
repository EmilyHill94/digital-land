[Local plans](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/plan-making) set out local planning policies, identify how land is used, and decide what will be built where. They are a rich source of information, but the equally useful data used to produce them isn’t easily extracted. For example, a local plan might show a map of where housing will be built, but the data that made the map (such as addresses and coordinates) is not made available.


The Digital Land team and policy specialists at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government are working with local planning authorities to design a data format for publishing local plan data so that it’s easy to find, use and trust.
