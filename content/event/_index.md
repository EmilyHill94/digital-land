### This week at Digital Land

**Date:** 21 June 2019

This week in the Digital Land team, Adam, Colm and Jake have been working on the brownfield sites validator. Paul D has also been looking at the data published in brownfield registers to help design a [simpler format](https://github.com/digital-land/brownfield-sites-report). He also held a fireside chat with Emma Williamson of Haringey at the [digileaders event](https://nd19.co.uk/agenda-2019).

Colm has also been working on Digital Land Front-end, creating component macros and converting templates into Jinja templating language, so they can be used with Flask applications. 

Christine has been part of a week long hackathon with members of other digital teams. They have been joined by consultants from Microsoft to look into using topic modeling technologies to investigate which topics MHCLG are discussing the most with Local Authorities. 

Matt met with the Planning Caseworker team in Birmingham to understand more about the systems that they use to manage CPOs (Compulsory Purchase Orders). There are 2 systems: Planet and Horizon. It was useful to see the data they collect and gain some ideas about how we can extract the data which we’ll be testing over the next few days. He also attended the Greater London Authority show and tell for their alpha funded LDCU project. In addition, along with Rebecca and Colm, he worked on creating a draft of the OKRs for the team which will soon be available on the website. 

Rebecca also facilitated a retro for the local digital collaboration unit, as well as helping to arrange the joint internal showcase with the local digital collaboration unit. Michael has been reviewing comments on the first draft of the Local Plans project page. He has also completed a draft text on the team vision and mission statement, which is now ready for review.

In the policy end of the team, Natalie has been providing digital policy support to housing and planning colleagues across the department this week for a number of projects, as well as looking at financial planning for future projects. Jess has been finalising the PropTech strategy report and setting out recommendations for future engagement. Finally, Ed’s blog post called [Lessons we learned at the Future PropTech exhibition](https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2019/06/18/lessons-we-learned-at-the-future-proptech-exhibition/) went live on the MHCLG Digital blog page this week.

This week, we spent Tuesday and Wednesday together at our Team Away days. We kicked off with a team retrospective, which led to discussions around building further relationships with policy teams and how to improve the delivery of products we're working on. We also went to the [Imaginary Cities exhibition at the British Library](https://www.bl.uk/events/imaginary-cities) and were joined by Lorna, our new user researcher.

Rebecca met with policy teams to talk about how we capture policy needs in our team planning, and met with Cities and Local Growth (CLOG) team to action things from last weeks [One Team Gov wellbeing camp](https://medium.com/oneteamgov/one-team-gov-wellbeing-camp-411c409946df).

Jake and Emily spent the week preparing for and attended the Energy Performance of Buildings alpha assessment with the Digital Delivery team.

Christine has been working out the next steps for the register tools with Adam, Matt and Colm.

Matt wrote a draft offer document for empty buildings project, and met with Campaign to Protect Rural England to discuss their needs around brownfield land data.

Rebecca and Ed also attended Christine's weekly code club, focusing on [Classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)) and [Methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)).

### This week at Digital Land

**Date:** 7 June 2019

The big news this week was new regulations for [The Community Infrastructure Levy (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2019](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111185582) have been laid before Parliament, an important step for the [developer contributions](https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/) policy.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/48008447912/" title="Data collection workshop"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48008447912_ebb133eaaf_c.jpg" alt="Data collection workshop"></a>

Paul D participated in the first [Product Management community of practice](https://twitter.com/psd/status/1136900443026669569) meeting organised by Sam and represented the team at a workshop looking at how the department collects data for analysis, which resulted in these postits to explain Digital Land:

Natalie and Ed have been meeting the policy teams we're working with and Natalie went to the third <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/events/data-bites-3-getting-things-done-data-government">Data Bites event at the Institute for Government</a> meaning someone from the team has been to each one.

Helena has been continuing our research into [local plans](https://digital-land.github.io/project/local-plans/), and begun a plan for improving our design process, starting with how we investigate prospective projects and shape discoveries.

Christine has been continuing to prototype the registers editor, adding a check-entry page, and Jake has begun work on a [proof of concept](https://github.com/digital-land/validator-serverless) for the Registers validator using [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) and [Lambda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWS_Lambda).

Rebecca was in Leeds for the [One team gov wellbeing camp](https://medium.com/oneteamgov/one-team-gov-wellbeing-camp-411c409946df) and Emily picked up lots of practical tips and tricks from a [content design course](https://contentdesign.london/content-design-2-day-course/) in Bristol where her writing was subjected to a 20 person [content crit](https://contentdesign.london/content-design/content-crits/)!

The [Building a safer future: proposals for reform of the building safety regulatory system](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/building-a-safer-future-proposals-for-reform-of-the-building-safety-regulatory-system) public consultation was opened which will inform any future discovery work for the [golden thread](https://digital-land.github.io/project/golden-thread-of-building-information/) project.

### This week at Digital Land

**Date:** 27 May 2019

This week Christine has been prototyping the registers editor and Paul D has been revisiting the [python open register library](https://pypi.org/project/openregister/0.8.8/). Adam and Colm have been tweaking the housing numbers prototype which is part of our bigger local plans project.

On Tuesday Paul D and Matt visited Bristol to learn more about compulsory purchase orders (CPOs). They met with colleagues from policy, the planning caseworker unit and the Planning Inspectorate. During the workshop they explored the process of raising and managing CPOs and looked at the decision making process. They then looked at the data and discussed how to make it publicly available.

Emily and Michael have been working on some exciting new Digital Land website designs and content. Jake has been integrating a new content management system and building the designs in code – watch this space!

### This week at Digital Land

**Date:** 20 May 2019

It’s been a big week for the team as digital services and policy have merged! Ed Culliney and new recruit Natalie Record have joined the team, marking the official joining of Digital Land services with policy – the ultimate multidisciplinary team.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's official! No more separate Digital Land 'Services' and 'Policy' teams ... just one big happy Digital Land team with policy and services working together. Living the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OneTeamGov?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OneTeamGov</a> dream 🙌 <a href="https://t.co/tKyRCclJtC">pic.twitter.com/tKyRCclJtC</a></p>&mdash; Rebecca Pye (@becpye) <a href="https://twitter.com/becpye/status/1131241801933832194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Ed, Natalie, Christine and Emily also attended a GDS academy course on agile training for teams. The training was brilliant, involving kanban board games, lean races, and exercises in scrum ways of working. We’re looking forward to applying our learning in the coming weeks.

Paul D presented our vision at the Future City Catapult event, meeting new people from across the industry. Back in the office, Jake and Adam (developers) have been working on some exciting website plans, researching a new CMS which allows everyone in the team to easily publish and maintain content.

Paul B (user researcher) spoke with a council who are collaborating with other neighbouring councils on a Joint Strategic Plan. Paul B and Helena (service designer) also ran a workshop with teams from MHCLG’s housing directorate to understand their needs from local plans. The meeting confirmed some of the initial findings and also shed new light on how the status of local plans is important to different parts of the organisation.

### This week at Digital Land Services

**Date:** 06 May 2019

#### Local plans

This week, Paul (Bermudez) and Helena have been busy working on the tail end of the [Local Plans discovery](/project/local-plans). Their primary focus has been to analyse the insights that they've gathered so far ahead of an internal steering group next week.

On another aspect of Local Plans, the [housing numbers](/project/housing-numbers), our colleagues on the policy team have collected housing numbers from local plans. The vast majority of Local Planning Authorities have now been accounted for, and Colm and Adam are helping to make some changes to how we capture data for joint plans.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

#### Developer contributions

Following the developer contributions workshops and lab testing the team have been analysing the feedback to identify areas where we can make improvements. Emily and Michael have made a number of [changes to the guidance](/guidance/developer-contributions) which we hope will address some of the problem areas that we identified.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

#### Our service

Paul (Downey) has been working on some story mapping which forms a road map for the service. From this, Jake has been revisiting the work on a validator tool, and Christine has started prototyping a tool for building registers.

### Show and Tell
**Time:** 10 January 2019
**Location:** Digital Land, Ground Floor, Fry Building, London

We ran our first show and tell of 2019 where the team talked through the early view of the service architecture, our approach for learning about a design process for policy making, and what we've learnt through the early stages of the [developer contributions](/project/developer-contributions) public consultation.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### Team visit
**Time:** 20 December 2018
**Location:** New London Architecture

The team visited [New London Architecture](https://www.newlondonarchitecture.org/) where we held our weekly design crit. We also took the opportunity to see the [New London Model exhibition](https://www.newlondonarchitecture.org/whats-on/exhibitions/2018/the-new-london-model). If you get the chance it's definitely worth stopping by and seeing it for yourself.

### Show and Tell
**Time:** 6 December 2018 at 4pm
**Location:** F329, Fry Building, London

We showed our progress on [developer contributions](/project/developer-contributions). This included the updated guidance, a tool to validate local planning authority data against the specification, and how we'll be managing feedback during alpha.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/46152140552/in/datetaken/" title="Today&#x27;s Digital Land show and tell agenda"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4855/46152140552_f885f0fc64_k.jpg" alt="Today&#x27;s Digital Land show and tell agenda"></a>

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### Discovery workshop
**Time:** 22 November 2018
**Location:** City Hall, London

We held a discovery workshop hosted by the GLA with friends from TFL and Southwark to walk through our joint approach for [developer contributions](/project/developer-contributions).

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### This week at Digital Land Services
**Date:** 16 November 2018

This week the team focused on two area:

#### Brownfield sites

Michael has been updating the guidance on brownfield sites. He has a draft of the proposed content and the next step is to review with the brownfield policy team before replacing the existing guidance on GOV.UK. We hope that with clearer guidance, and being about to point to the validator tool the revised registers will be of improved quality once they’re updated in the new year.

#### Developer Contributions.

Building on the user needs work that we did last week we’ve now been able to put together a [proposed data specification](https://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/45138775504/). This is much simpler than what was proposed at the start of the project, and we hope that it’ll be easy for planning authorities to maintain. Today we talked through the data model with Southwark, they provided some useful feedback that we’ll incorporate. Over the next few weeks we’ll be testing the spec with a number of planning authorities to understand how it works.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### Show and Tell
**Time:** 15 November 2018
**Location:** First Floor SW, Fry Building

Matt showed his approach for wrangling people's needs of [developer contributions](/project/developer-contributions) data using a shared-document. Paul thinks this approach is worthy of a blog post.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/45180076944/" title="Needs wrangling"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4869/45180076944_6cb0492714_c.jpg" alt="Needs wrangling"></a>

Paul walked through the data model which is now much simpler as a result of Matt's work.

Matt has also been prototyping a developer contributions dashboard using Google Data Studio and a GOV.UK-ish stylesheet. Michael showed new guidance he has been drafting to help planning authorities publish their brownfield site registers, and some enhancements to the validator tool. Paul showed a flyer he'd made for an internal event.

### Digital Leaders Roundtable
**Time:** 15 November 2018
**Location:** Geovation, Sutton Yard

Paul presented the team's work at an event convened by the [housing minister](https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/minister-of-state-minister-for-housing) and leaders from across the housing, planning and PropTech industry. He learnt a lot from the discussion [[slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RdT7Z8wvPGyfTTD8_7fXIRJ6OatA9GnBl2zbmi0OfTY/edit?usp=sharing)].

### This week at Digital Land Services
**Date:** 09 November 2018

This week we continued further work on the brownfield site validator. You can now see a side-by-side comparison of some of the common errors (ie reversed GeoX and GeoY coordinates). For a number of the common errors we can automatically fix these, and provide the local authority with a valid .csv file that they can re-upload to their site.

We met with the [Greater London Authority](https://www.london.gov.uk/) (GLA) at City Hall. We talked about data standards and how that fits into their London Development Database initiative. Through the meeting with identified a number of areas of common interest, for example establishing a data standard around developer contributions, over the coming weeks we plan to hold join workshops between planning authorities, the GLA and MHCLG.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### This week at Digital Land Services
**Date:** 02 November 2018

A quiet team week with just two of us in the office. Adam continued to iterate the [brownfield sites validator](https://brownfield-sites-validator.cloudapps.digital/) and we revisited the collector for continuous validation. Paul joined [Linda](https://twitter.com/LindaSasta) for a workshop at [Future Cities Catapult](https://futurecities.catapult.org.uk/) on opportunities to work together, in particular with users of standards developed by Digital Land Services.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### Show and Tell
**Time:** 1 November 2018
**Location:** First Floor SW, Fry Building

We showed more work on collecting concerns, progress on developer contributions, and testing the brownfield sites registers with policy and local authority users.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### This week at Digital Land Services
**Date:** 26 October 2018

The team has been working on the [brownfield sites validator](https://brownfield-sites-validator.cloudapps.digital/) iterating the data model so we can understand the history of changes to registers. Of the 381 registers we have found 339 published, only 20 meet the standard, 5 with no errors. Over the course of the past two months, 32 have been moved or gone missing. We’re working on better guidance and tools to help publishers meet the standard.

We also had a quick show-and-tell with the implementation unit before talking about the golden thread recommendation from the [Hackitt review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-review-of-building-regulations-and-fire-safety-final-report).

Paul blogged about the [difficulties of making data from information, and cake](https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2018/10/25/data-and-information/).

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### This week at Digital Land Services
**Date:** 19 October 2018

The team visited the excellent [Living with Buildings exhibition](https://wellcomecollection.org/exhibitions/Wk4sPSQAACcANwrX) ahead of retrospective and [roadmapping](http://www.jamiearnold.com/blog/2014/07/22/seven-questions-to-build-a-roadmap) sessions in Camden. We were particularly surprised by the invective [Charles Booth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Booth_(social_reformer)) used on his poverty maps.

Following a meeting with one of the brownfield policy team we’ve done some further work on the validator to [plot the results of the validated data onto a map](https://digital-land.github.io/brownfield-sites/results/map/). There’s a bit more work we can do, but it’s something that we’re eager to take out and test.

We meet with [Leigh Dodds](https://twitter.com/ldodds) from the [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org/) (ODI) and ran a workshop to map out the relationship of people, documents and data within the planning ecosystem. It was a useful exercise and helped us think about connects between people/task and data from a different angle.

### This week at Digital Land Services
**Date: 12 October 2018**

Along with colleagues in the developer contribution policy team we met with one of the 3rd party suppliers of Section 106 management software. It was a productive meeting where we were able to explore possibilites of getting Section 106 data directly from their software in a format that meets our data standard. We'll continue to work together and with other suppliers to test this further.

We’ve continued to work on the [Digital Land website](http://digital-land.github.io). We’ve started to add [project pages](https://digital-land.github.io/project) to help us communicate the things we’re working on. There’s a bit more we need to do in order to get the information architecture right, but it’s getting there

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### This week at Digital Land Services
**Date:** 5 October 2018

We did some further work on the [brownfield site validator](https://brownfield-sites-validator.cloudapps.digital/), this was demoed by Adam in the show and tell on Thursday 4th. We also continued to add content to the [Digital Land website](https://digital-land.github.io), and begun to think about the future information architecture of the site.

We had a very interesting meeting with the [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org/) where we talked and demoed our respective work. There are definitely some shared goals between them and us, so over the coming weeks we plan to have a more detailed workshop to agree areas of reuse, and how we can work together.

Paul met [Dacorum Borough Council](http://www.dacorum.gov.uk/) they are interested in what we’re doing, and we hope to work with them to help test our alphas.

Paul also was invited to participate on a panel on “how data can change a marketplace” at the annual Ofgem conference

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### This week at Digital Land Services
**Date:** 28 September 2018

Over the past week the team have been looking at the following things:

#### Section 106 and Viability Assessments

We’ve been working closely with the Planning Policy Team and Local Planning Authorities to understand their needs around Section 106 and Viability Assessment data. We’ve learnt that although the NPPF encourages Local Authorities to publish this information the appetite to do so varies between each authority.

To help us learn more about what is needed we’ve built a [couple of prototypes](https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/#current-areas-of-investigation) that collects and publishes the pertinent information. Our next step is to test this with Local Authorities.

#### Brownfield Site Validator

We’ve picked up on [Brownfield Site Validator](https://brownfield-sites-validator.cloudapps.digital/) from a few months ago and added some enhancements to summarise the errors and warnings that have been found on each data set. Over the next week we’ll continue to work on this, and look at how we can automatically apply any quick fixes to improve the data set.

#### Document our findings

We’ve begun to [document our findings](https://digital-land.github.io), this includes learnings from discovery as well as some of the tools we’ve been taking into alpha. We’ll continue to create more content on the site, and build a homepage that describes what the team is doing

### This week at Digital Land Services
**Date:** 3 August 2018

This week the team continued working on [Section 106](https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/). We met with [Southwark Council](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/) who told us about the work their team are doing around collecting and publishing Section 106 data.

We’ve also started to build an [online form](https://section-106-prototype.cloudapps.digital/create-section106) to collect Section 106 summary and Viability Assessment summary data. We’ll use this to help test the data standard with Local Planning Authorities.

### This week at Digital Land Services
**Date:** 27 July 2019

This week the Digital Land Services team ran their first show and tell where we talked about some of our findings from discovery, and demoed an early view of the ‘brownfield sites validator’ tool. We plan to run future show and tells on a fortnightly basis, and hope to be able to make them publicly available soon.

We continued development work on the [‘brownfield sites validator’](https://brownfield-sites-validator.cloudapps.digital/) which now feeds back whether a given set of data meets the specification, and if not where the problems are. Our next step is to provide a visual representation of the data on a map.

The team also had a rare opportunity to be co-located for a few days, we used this time to run some design sessions, and conduct an end of discovery retrospective.

### This week at Digital Land Services
**Date:** 15 June 2018

We were joined this week by [Matt Lucht](https://twitter.com/mattlucht), our new delivery manager, Michael Nottingham, our new part-time content editor and by [Alex Blandford](https://twitter.com/blangry), a user researcher working for Rose. We’ve begun to write-up our discovery findings which we plan to present on the 28th and publish publicly on our new blog shortly afterwards.

### This week at Digital Land Services
**Date:** 8 June 2018

Rose has been recruiting participants to give us insight into how the brownfield registers were made, and if they are working for users. We were joined by [Alex Blandford](https://twitter.com/blangry), who has been helping us start our end-of-discovery report.

We rebuilt our [data collector](https://github.com/communitiesuk/digital-land-collector) and started to collect tree preservation orders and contaminated land datasets published by planning authorities. So far this has meant sending out 120 emails, many of which we learnt, arrived in the inbox of one person working at [Misoportal](https://misoportal.com/)

Next week we’re joined by [Matt Lucht](https://twitter.com/mattlucht), our new delivery manager and later in the week, by Michael Nottingham, our content editor.
