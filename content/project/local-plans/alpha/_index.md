In March 2020, we opened an [supplier opportunity](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/digital-outcomes-and-specialists/opportunities/11591) on Digital Marketplace to work on the Local Plans alpha phase. It was awarded to [dxw digital](https://www.dxw.com/).

The alpha tested ideas for the better use of data held about, and within local plans. Read the [end of project alpha report](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hDLvKZyKNM-bw1fBUPV-59XkNkzzeFv7SKvINwxqLGA/edit?usp=sharing). You can find out more about the work completed in each sprint in the weeknotes and show and tells below. 

## Prototypes

[Version 1](https://local-plan.herokuapp.com/v1) of the prototype focuses on an exemplar local plan page for local authorities, including a policy data table. It was tested with 3 local planning authorities.

[Version 2](https://local-plan.herokuapp.com/v2) of the prototype focuses on plan data (including plan timetables) at the national level and for individual planning authorities. It was tested with 5 (PINS and MHCLG) participants.

[Version 3](https://local-plan.herokuapp.com/v3) of the prototype includes a national dataset page on plans and policies, timetable overview, an overview and details page for a local planning authority and guidance on publishing plan data. It was tested with 5 local planning authorities.
