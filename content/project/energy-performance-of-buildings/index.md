The energy performance of buildings (EPB) team within the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) Digital Directorate have been building a new online service to help users find an energy certificate, or to find an energy assessor. Part of this journey is to find an [energy performance certificate (EPC)](https://www.gov.uk/buy-sell-your-home/energy-performance-certificates).

The team recently passed their GOV.UK alpha assessment and are moving into beta, testing and iterating the current prototype.

The [existing EPC register](https://www.epcregister.com/) has a complex user journey. Simplifying this journey and the online content will help users complete their tasks more easily.

**Publishing EPC data**

Energy certificates are built on a rich source of housing data. However recent changes in data privacy regulations meant that MHCLG stopped updating and publishing the raw data from EPCs. 

Our research showed that there is a need for this data. For example, not only do EPCs tell people how to save energy and money, but they were the primary source of bulk open data on a property’s floor area in square metres. Our research also showed that publishing the data is allowed under the privacy regulations.

Over the last year, the work of the Digital Land team’s policy specialists has resulted in the decision to publish EPC data once again. The data is now available on [Open Data Communities](https://epc.opendatacommunities.org/) and will be updated every 6 months.

[Read our blog](https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2019/07/18/publishing-energy-performance-certificate-data/) to find out more about the user research and policy work involved in opening up EPC data again, or [contact the Digital Land team](mailto:DigitalLand@communities.gov.uk) if you’re interested in EPC data.
