## Agile working

We work as a digital design team, meaning we work iteratively, using agile methodology. We design products and services to meet the needs of our users, which we discover through research. We regularly test our products and services with users, and improve them iteratively, which reduces risk. 

We work in 2-week sprints, making it easier to manage and prioritise tasks. During each sprint, agile ceremonies help us communicate and collaborate as a multidisciplinary team. We encourage stakeholders to attend these to keep them up to date and to receive regular feedback. These ceremonies include:

* daily standups to each give short updates to spot risks or blockers to progress
* fortnightly retrospectives to shape and improve our ways of working
* fortnightly planning sessions to prioritise and plan our work for the next sprint
* fortnightly show and tells to demo what has been learnt, designed or built

An important aspect of our way of working is [the digital design process](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery). Where there is a new, large problem space, as is the case with a project like the [golden thread of building information](/project/golden-thread-of-building-information/), we’ll encourage teams to run a [discovery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works) and [alpha](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works) phase. The work required to make a dataset available will be different in every project. A discovery ensures that the area is well understood and solutions are based on user needs. This will also help to prioritise and shape the alpha phase of a project.

As is the case with [brownfield land](/project/brownfield-sites/), not all projects need a thorough discovery phase, since this is already an existing policy area that is well understood. With projects like this, our focus once we are up-to-speed is on refining the solutions that already exist, using existing data to evidence decisions.


## Working in the open

Working in the open encourages collaboration with teams working in similar areas, suppliers interested in working with us, and users who want to know more about our work or offer feedback. It’s also a great way for us to keep a record of our design decisions, as well as questions, assumptions and hypothesis, which in turn builds the trust of our users and stakeholders. Wherever possible we record our work publicly, using the following tools:

* [project pages](/project/)
* [weeknotes](/weeknote/)
* [blog posts](/blog-post/)
* [GitHub issues](https://github.com/digital-land/digital-land/issues)
* [guidance on data principles](/guidance/data-principles/)

## Prioritising work

There is a huge amount of work to be done improving the quality and accessibility of land and housing data. Therefore, we have to carefully choose and prioritise which datasets we focus on and, within a project, how we prioritise tasks. The following are some of our main considerations when prioritising work:

### [Users](/users/)

Before we design and build solutions, we research and understand the needs of the users within the project area. We then prioritise our work based on how to best meet our user’s needs.

#### Policy

We work closely with colleagues from the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government to understand new and changing policy requirements. We then prioritise improving the quality and accessibility of datasets that can support decision making and improve policy outcomes.

#### PropTech

We are also working closely with the emerging PropTech communities to understand what data they need to be made available to [support their product and services](/about/#our-mission).

#### Local planning authorities

During most of our projects, we work closely with local planning authorities, finding ways to help them publish the data they hold in a way that is not overly burdensome to them. We’re also helping local authority digital teams build tools for the Planning Tech sector by supporting their data needs.

### Data

We estimate there are around 300 types of policy related to land and housing, each of which is informed by a number of different datasets. Often the same dataset informs a number of different policies. We often prioritise projects in which the data already exists, since creating positive outcomes in these areas will be quicker and easier.

## Choosing a team

Depending on the phase of a project, a different shape team will be needed. An early discovery project will be more focussed on user research, whereas a project in alpha or beta may need developers and designers who can help prototype ideas to be tested.

We can help you identify the shape and size of the team, and support you through the process of onboarding via the [Digital Marketplace](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service). 

Projects for which we’ve sourced a team through the Digital Marketplace include:

* [single register of planning](/project/single-register-of-planning/) alpha phase
* [energy performance of buildings](/project/energy-performance-of-buildings/) beta phase
* [local plans](/project/local-plans/) alpha phase

## Starting a project

At the start of each project it is important to ensure every person involved is on the same page. One way to do this is running an inception with the project team and stakeholders. The purpose of the inception is to ensure everyone is aware of the project boundaries, share corporate knowledge, and outline our approach.

We will also produce an offer document at the beginning of each project for our stakeholders or supplier. This will outline:

* our starting understanding of the scope of the project
* who’s in the team
* stakeholders
* key outcomes we expect to achieve
* an outline approach
* our ways of working

## Measuring success

At the start of each phase of a project we will agree the intended outcomes, and the success (or determination that the phase is “done”) will be measured against these.

Different phases of projects will be measured in different ways. Projects in their discovery phase can be timeboxed, and at the end of which we can assess as a team whether we’ve learnt enough to decide how we move forward.

Every 2 months there is a steering group led by the Director of Planning. The purpose of the steering group is to review progress of key projects, manage project risks, and to agree priorities either in scope changes or new work. Digital Land is represented by the Head of Digital Land, Digital Policy, with project leads asked to attend as needed.
