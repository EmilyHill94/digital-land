## Timeline

**May 2019**

Paul D and Matt visited Bristol to learn more about CPOs. Meeting with colleagues from policy, the planning caseworker unit and the Planning Inspectorate, they explored the process of raising and managing CPOs and looked at the decision making process. They then looked at the data and discussed how to make it publicly available.

**Spring 2019**

We are planning a discovery workshop with the policy team, Planning Inspectorate and the Planning Caseworker Unit to identify user needs and agree next steps.
